Responsible Business Alliance Work Hours rules protects human rights. For Seagate Woodlands, in summary, each worker can only work max of 12 hours per shift, 60 hours per work week, max of 72 hours of 1.5 (weekday) OT per calendar month and lastly, no continous work between 2 workweeks.

The reason for the custom Excel Based Macro-run tool is to detect early violations DURING PLANNING STAGE so that the violations gets stopped before it gets executed but employees who might be clueless or careless and by Supervisors that might overlook due to vast amount of visual data that needs to be processed.

This tool saved W3 MDW Hardown Team from hard RBA rule violations MONTHS AHEAD of the rest of the organisation. Although some down time needs to be mentioned due to debugging once the tool went live.
